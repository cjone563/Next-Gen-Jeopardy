# Next-Gen-Jeopardy

This is a Jeopardy simulation that allows multiple teams of three players to enjoy together.

Users will be able to answer a large array of questions regarding various categories. 

The code will also allow users to choose the number of teams up to 3 (one person per team).  

Within the software, we will implement six different columns showcasing the question categories as headers along with the six rows below with the number of points ranging from 100-1000. 

Within the programming, we will install a function that will showcase a red “X” whenever an individual answers incorrectly.

We will implement a 15 second timer for regular questions as well as 25 second timer for Daily Doubles questions. 

If a player answers correctly, that person will receive the dollar value of the amount showcased on the selected question. 

There will be a function that deducts the dollar value of the selected question if a player answers incorrectly or fails to answer within the time given.

Daily Doubles will appear on the screen as such, and the question will be from a category chosen by the leading team.

The team with the most accumulated points has to answer correctly for them to increase their total by the chosen dollar amount.

If the first team answers incorrectly, the team with the second highest accumulated dollar value will follow the same steps as the first team.

Whichever team has the most money at the end of the game wins.

Enjoy!
